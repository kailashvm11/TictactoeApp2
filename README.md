# TicTacToe
TicTacToe is a game between two players, X and O, who take turns marking the
 spaces in a 3x3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks
in a diagonal, horizontal, or vertical row is the winner. The game can end in
a draw if both players fail to achieve three marks in a row and if all the cells are
filled

to be placed. Row and columns need to be entered between the range 1 to 3. For example to
mark the cell in the middle the coordinates to be entered is 2 2. A space need to be
entered between the row and column.
 
 First player always starts with the X mark and the next player with the O mark.
